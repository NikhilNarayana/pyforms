# PyForms-Lite

PyForms-Lite provides all the features of PyForms without the extra controls like `ControlVisVis(Volume)` and `ControlOpenGL` and others. A more detailed list will be available later.

Go checkout [PyForms](https://github.com/UmSenhorQualquer/pyforms) for more info, all the tutorials should give a good idea on how to work with it.

# Note
This module will not work with PyForms installed.
